# Project Overview

A classic Tetris game implemented in Python using Pygame.

This project was entirely generated by Aider, an AI-powered code generation tool. I have not reviewed the code, and all commits were made by Aider. This is my first attempt at using Aider to explore its capabilities. For more details on my experience, please refer to my article: [Code Generation with Aider: A Quick Look](https://medium.com/@naoko.reeves/code-generation-with-aider-a-quick-look-8e0bfedd6009).
